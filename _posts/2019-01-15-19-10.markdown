遂发现，尝试的次数和你所获得的收益永远成正比。多交流，多试错，多见识，才能多长智。

```java
There is a case for remote-overrides: users have overridden apollo activate scripts and then run brazil ws env update for remote-overrides.

In this case, users have to run activate after running remote override update command.

It would be really powerful if after I run 'brazil ws env update' that environment also activated. This could be controlled by a flag (--activate).
```
